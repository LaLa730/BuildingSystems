# BuildingSystems

I used both PyCharm and Visual Studio Code for for this project.

The src code file is for the frontend, Visual Studio Code.

The rest of the files are for the backend, Pycharm.

There were problems and my laptop just would not run git hence why they were uploaded like this and not pushed from the IDEs.

Thanks for reading this it was a very long but fun Project :)
